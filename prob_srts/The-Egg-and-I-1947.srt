1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,239
- Whoops!
Now look what you've done.

3
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,118
No harm done, ma'am.
It's only an egg.

4
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,954
- Only an egg?
- Yes, ma'am. Just a little old egg.

5
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,430
I suppose it never occurred to you
that this egg is somebody's child.

6
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,397
- That it once had a mother.
- No, ma'am.

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,835
- And a father.
- Yes, ma'am.

8
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,117
You're one of those people who thinks
a chicken lays an egg all by herself.

9
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,591
- Yes, ma'am!
- Well, she doesn't. She lays it with help.

10
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,708
- And I ought to know because I helped her.
- Yes, indeed, ma'am!

11
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,475
Telling me about eggs.

12
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,279
And I'll bet you think an egg is something
you casually order for breakfast...

13
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,511
when you can't think
of anything else.

14
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,593
<i>Well, so did I once.
But that was before The Egg And I.</i>

15
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,998
<i># This is the day
they give babies away #</i>

16
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,911
<i># With a half a pound of tea #</i>

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,754
<i># You open the lid and out pops a kid
with a half a pound of tea #</i>

18
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,391
<i>- Betty?
- Hmm?</i>

19
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,951
<i>- Remember once we talked about
maybe having a farm someday? - Uh-huh.</i>

20
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,793
<i>- Have you thought about it since?
- Uh-uh.</i>

21
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,112
<i>I have. Betty, you ever think how we're
going to spend the rest of our lives?</i>

22
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,672
Whatever my husband chooses
to do, it's all right with me.

23
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,958
The question is, are we going to trod the old
paths or break new roads into the wilderness?

24
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,395
I don't know.
Which?

25
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,278
You know, Betty, when you're
lying in a foxhole in Okinawa...

26
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,669
you got plenty of time
to think things out.

27
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,399
You know what I said to myself?
I said, "Just exactly what...

28
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,278
have Saddle, Finch, Tanner, Pease
and Stuck to do with all this?"

29
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,669
<i>- You know what the answer was?
- Uh-uh.</i>

30
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,151
<i>Nothing, absolutely nothing. That's why I'm
not going back to be a mere customer's man...</i>

31
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,834
<i>- at Saddle, Finch, Tanner, Pease and Stuck.
- Aren't you?</i>

32
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,596
I am not. I resigned yesterday. Hang
Saddle, Finch, Tanner, Pease and Stuck.

33
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,195
<i>Well, you'll find
something else I'm sure.</i>

34
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,078
- We'll talk about it in the morning, hmm?
- Do you know what a fellow...

35
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,991
thinks about when he's
lying out there in the mud...

36
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,675
- with the shells bursting all around him?
- I'd think about you.

37
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,354
He thinks about the fundamental things.
The things that really count.

38
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,069
The basic things.
Love, food, babies.

39
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,233
Things growing out of the ground.
He thinks about cows, horses...

40
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,835
Do you know what I dreamt
about most, Betty?

41
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,117
- Tell me, darling.
- About chickens.

42
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,634
- Chickens?
- Can't you just picture it, Betty?

43
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,395
Just you and me all by ourselves with
thousands and thousands of chickens.

44
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,630
Everyone of them
laying eggs all day long.

45
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,792
- What would we do with that many eggs?
- We'd sell them!

46
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,793
- Those we don't keep for incubating.
- Incubating?

47
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,032
- Darling, I bought a chicken farm.
- A chicken farm?

48
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,350
It's the most wonderful place
you can possibly imagine.

49
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,275
It's situated high up in the mountains.
Miles from everywhere, 40 beautiful acres.

50
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,273
That sounds fine.
We'll go there every weekend.

51
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,911
Every weekend? Honey, we're gonna live there
all the time! We're gonna raise chickens.

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,276
<i>- Are we?
- You bet we are.</i>

53
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,069
You have no idea what a fascinating
little devil a chicken can be.

54
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,549
There must be over 100 varieties.
Australorps, Dorkings.

55
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,312
Leghorns...
twelve different kinds of them.

56
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,038
The New Hampshire Red,
the Rhode Island Red.

57
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,839
<i>The Light Brahma, the Black Sumatra,
theJersey White Giant.</i>

58
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,876
<i>The Plymouth Rock, the Barbrock.
There are millions of them.</i>

59
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,351
<i>Take the average White Leghorn
that lays 150 to 250 eggs a year.</i>

60
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,512
<i>- We'll say she costs between
$2.25 and $2.50 to raise...</i>

61
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,955
<i>They all right back there?</i>

62
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,918
Oh, they're fine.
They love it.

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,116
<i>Of course, our profit will vary...</i>

64
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,910
The percentage of cockerels is a vital
factor in determining the cost of each pullet.

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,754
You've got to keep watching for those
little combs to break out of the shells.

66
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,196
Then you separate 'em, fatten 'em up,
dress 'em and off to market they go.

67
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,590
<i>Oh, my hat! Oh, Bob, stop!</i>

68
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,116
Can't stop here.
We'll get it later.

69
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,919
He's eating it!

70
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,398
Don't worry.
It won't hurt him.

71
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,632
- How much longer?
- Pretty soon now.

72
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,678
- Beautiful country, isn't it?
- Mmm.

73
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,191
- Seems so far away.
- Far away from what?

74
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,716
I don't know.
Just far away.

75
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,278
- Get ready, Betty.
- Are we there?

76
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,036
In a minute. Close your eyes.
I want to surprise you with it.

77
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,352
- They were closed.
- Close them again.

78
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,840
All right, open 'em.

79
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,552
- Where's the house?
- That's it right there.

80
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,517
Oh.

81
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,830
<i>Needs a new coat of paint.</i>

82
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,469
The agent told me there wasn't another
house like it in the whole county.

83
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,949
Come on,
I'll show it to you.

84
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,319
Isn't this the most beautiful setting
for a house you ever saw?

85
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,710
Isn't it wonderful?

86
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,792
How do you like this view
from the front porch?

87
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,513
Well, honey, this is it.

88
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,558
Over the threshold.

89
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,556
- Oh!
- Hang on.

90
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,315
- Darling, you'd better put me down.
- Yeah, I...

91
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,834
It's stuck.
I'll have to force it.

92
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,036
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

93
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,954
- Those hinges must have loosened up.
- Oh.

94
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,030
I'll fix that. Well, honey,
what do you think?

95
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,318
Hasn't it got a lot of character?
That stairway goes up to the attic.

96
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,870
This is the bedroom.
This is the living room.

97
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,069
<i>Nice size room,
isn't it?</i>

98
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,039
<i>- Good floors. Won't have
to do a thing to 'em.</i>

99
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,918
<i>Just scrub 'em
and polish 'em.</i>

100
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,636
<i>Here's the dining room.</i>

101
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,918
They don't build houses
like this nowadays.

102
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,391
This table isn't bad, is it?
Solid oak.

103
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,436
Don't care much for
that fixture though, do you?

104
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,469
Wait'll you see the kitchen. Isn't this
something? An old-fashioned kitchen.

105
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,838
Haven't seen one like this since I was a kid.
None of that streamlined stuff.

106
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,480
This is the kind of place where you can
really get down to living.

107
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,791
No running water, no Frigidaire.
Just plenty of elbow room.

108
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,036
Here's the back porch
out here.

109
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,950
Go on, take a look. That's
the chicken house over there.

110
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,838
<i>Of course, we'll have
to make it bigger.</i>

111
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,797
<i>Those woods back there
belong to us too.</i>

112
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,919
<i>Isn't that some barn?
That's the pigpen in front of it.</i>

113
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,798
<i>Compact little layout, isn't it?
It needs a little sprucing up.</i>

114
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,236
Some paint, some patches. We'll get
started on that in the morning.

115
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,595
Come on, I'll show you
the rest of the house.

116
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,753
<i>You haven't seen anything yet. It keeps
getting better and better. Here's the pantry.</i>

117
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,400
These steps go to the cellar
where we can store vegetables...

118
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,869
and all those canned goods
you're going to put up.

119
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,189
What's that?

120
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,431
Huh? Oh!
Isn't that a beauty?

121
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,114
I bet you've never seen a stove
like that in all your life.

122
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,397
Just aching for a big side of beef
or a pot full of soup...

123
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,789
or couple of
dozen loaves of bread.

124
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,916
Fresh bread.
I can smell it already.

125
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,390
You're going to have
a wonderful time with that stove.

126
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,392
You can get to the bedroom
right through the kitchen here.

127
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,996
I don't think it likes me.

128
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,470
<i>- Betty?
- Coming.</i>

129
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,511
You and I, my friend, are not
going to get along at all.

130
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,592
- Bob...
- How do you like this bed?

131
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,956
- Isn't it a wonderful old piece?
- Hmm.

132
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,635
It needs a little
propping up.

133
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,188
<i>There, that ought to do it.</i>

134
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,919
Kind of noisy,
don't you think?

135
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,549
- Isn't this the life, Betty?
- I guess so.

136
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,518
Once you get used to it.

137
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,992
- It's raining.
- Right through the roof.

138
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,913
<i>Gesundheit.</i>

139
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,788
There, we'll be
all right here.

140
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,429
I'll have to get up on that roof. Some
of the shingles must have loosened up.

141
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,430
You catching cold? You must have
been sitting in a draught.

142
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,399
- Ah, I must have.
- You better get in bed.

143
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,909
Ah, just smell that. Wonderful to fill
your lungs with clean air for a change.

144
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,913
Well, the first night
in our own home.

145
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,309
<i>Doesn't it feel great, Betty?</i>

146
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,949
Gonna make it a real home too.
Something to be proud of.

147
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,238
None of that hit-and-run stuff for us.

148
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,357
Just think, Betty,
this is where we'll...

149
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,318
probably spend
the rest of our lives.

150
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,870
- Doesn't it give you
a wonderful sense of security?

151
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,953
Now, then, everything's
gotta be scheduled.

152
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,555
Can't leave anything to chance.
Farming's a big enough gamble as it is.

153
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,200
Now by June we should have
at least a half-dozen sucklings.

154
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,750
We'll have a calf in July.

155
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,356
Then, along about August, we can begin
to figure on more important offspring.

156
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,477
- Oh, darling.
- Maybe 500 or 600 of them.

157
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,994
- 500, 600 what?
- Chicks, of course.

158
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,196
Maybe even more
if we're lucky.

159
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,875
I'd like to raise something
besides chickens, you know.

160
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,033
Oh, we'll have plenty of those too.
I'm counting on at least four.

161
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,157
Maybe even five.
Three boys and two girls, huh?

162
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,676
- All at once?
- Oh, no, one at a time.

163
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,719
Let's schedule the first one
for, uh, a year from today.

164
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,588
<i>- How's that?
- That looks like a good day for it.</i>

165
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,074
<i>## Betty?</i>

166
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,799
<i>Betty?</i>

167
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,791
Hmm?

168
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,269
Hey, Betty?

169
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,158
Wake up. Didn't you
hear the alarm clock?

170
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,390
<i>You gonna lie there in bed forever?
Come on, get out.</i>

171
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,109
<i>- I've got breakfast almost ready.
- Hmm?</i>

172
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,391
It's still night out.

173
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,439
<i>What do you mean "night"?
It's 4:30. Half the morning's gone.</i>

174
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,274
I let you loll in bed
because it's the first day...

175
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,193
but from now on you've got to be
up every morning at 4:00 sharp.

176
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,709
<i>- Hey, Betty?
- Hmm?</i>

177
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,917
<i>Come on, get out of there!
Got a lot of work to do.</i>

178
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,076
Betty!

179
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,956
Bob!

180
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,360
How are those nails,
Betty?

181
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,710
- Oh! Bob!
- Yeah?

182
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,634
<i>Hey, Betty?</i>

183
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,829
Hey, Betty,
what are you doing down there?

184
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,798
Oh!

185
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,120
Just dropped in
to say howdy.

186
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,078
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

187
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,036
Ma told me to come by and ask you
over for a visit when you got time.

188
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,795
We're your neighbours
just down the road a spell.

189
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,952
Kettle's the name.
Folks call me Pa.

190
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,560
- I'm glad to know ya, Pa.
- Likewise.

191
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,955
- Hello!
- Hi.

192
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,871
This is my husband.
Meet Pa Kettle, Bob.

193
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,077
- Just dropped in to say howdy.
- Well, uh, howdy.

194
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,118
Howdy. Thought I'd tell ya
long as we're neighbours...

195
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,590
you can count on us for
anything you might be needin'.

196
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,752
Just step in and ask for it.
Be glad to lend a helpin' hand.

197
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,671
Thanks, Mr Kettle.
That's very nice of you.

198
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,469
- Building somethin'?
- Yes, we're putting up a new chicken coop.

199
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,472
Wouldn't mind having
a few of them two-by-fours.

200
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,109
Been fixin' my barn. Ain't
had no time to get to town.

201
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,317
- Go ahead. Help yourself.
- That's real neighbourly of you.

202
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,188
Won't be needin'
more than two... or so.

203
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,436
- Give me a holt here, will ya?
- You bet.

204
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,717
Oh, uh, two more...
just in case.

205
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,119
Oh, uh, better have
another one for good measure.

206
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,799
- Sure you got enough?
- Well, maybe one more for the house.

207
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,353
- Huh?
- I'll take 'em.

208
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,874
I'm gonna need a couple of pounds of nails.
Ain't got none to fit a two-by-four.

209
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,916
I guess I can let you
have a couple of pounds.

210
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,472
And an extra hammer and a saw. Kids
been usin' my saw and ruined the edge.

211
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,994
- Couldn't cut butter with it now.
- I'll give you a hammer and saw.

212
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,914
- I have to have them back.
- Send it back as soon as I'm through.

213
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,878
Come around the barn.
I'll see what I can dig up.

214
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,719
Say, you'll have to paint the place,
won't ya?

215
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,314
- Have you got any paint?
- Come to think of it, I ain't.

216
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,868
- Got any red you could spare?
- No, we've only got green.

217
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,350
Green will do.
I ain't particular.

218
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,676
Gee-up, there.

219
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,557
There! I'll bet you've never looked as good
as this in your whole life.

220
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,236
<i>Oh! Oh, you!</i>

221
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:51,469
Indians! Bob!

222
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,394
<i>Bob! Bob!
Indians!</i>

223
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,632
- What are you talking about?
- There, by the porch!

224
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,917
- That's Geoduck and Crowbar.
- Who?

225
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,072
- Geoduck and Crowbar. They sell fish.
- Fish?

226
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,628
You've been seeing too many
Westerns. Hiya, fellas.

227
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,110
- How!
- Betty, look at these crabs.

228
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,317
- Get a load of the size.
- Are we gonna raise them too?

229
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,951
We'll take a dozen. Just put 'em on
the back porch. Give a hand, will you, Tom?

230
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,669
- Say, who's Tom?
- He's Pa Kettle's boy. He's gonna work for us.

231
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,594
- Hope he doesn't take after his father.
- So far, he hasn't borrowed a thing.

232
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,831
I've been looking at the egg charts. Have
you been collecting the eggs regularly?

233
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,595
- Well, not exactly. They won't let me.
- They won't let you?

234
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,514
No, anyway it seems kind of cruel
to break up the family so early.

235
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,910
It's no joke. Those eggs have to be
collected regularly.

236
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,072
Couldn't I do
something else instead?

237
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,199
There's nothing difficult about it.
A child can do it.

238
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,750
- They look at me so hurt. I haven't got the heart.
- That's ridiculous.

239
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,831
Here I'll show you.

240
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,435
They don't act like that
when I do it.

241
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,080
Let's see you do it.

242
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,628
There! Now you see?

243
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,359
- That's funny.
- They don't like me.

244
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,716
Maybe you have the wrong attitude.
Chickens sense things in people.

245
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,234
Frankly, I think they're
stuck on you and resent me.

246
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,709
Maybe I better collect the eggs.
You do something else.

247
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,394
- Have you fed Cleopatra?
- No, I was just going to.

248
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,996
- She'll never get fat if you don't feed her.
- She's as fat as a pig now.

249
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,115
Okay, toots,
come and get it.

250
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,474
<i>No, you don't! You come right back here
this minute!</i>

251
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,120
Cleopatra,
do you hear me?

252
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,113
You get right back in this pen before
I do something you'll be very sorry for.

253
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,715
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

254
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,190
All right,
you asked for it. Come on.

255
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,989
Come on now. Get back in here.
Do you hear... Oh!

256
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,710
Come back here.
Cleopatra!

257
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,759
<i>Cleopatra, come back here!</i>

258
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,791
<i>Having any difficulty?</i>

259
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,594
Maybe I can help.

260
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,270
Here, pig, pig, pig!

261
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,079
<i>Come on, pig, pig, pig.
Piggy, piggy, piggy.</i>

262
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,355
<i>Here, pig.</i>

263
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,558
<i>Well, that's the idea.
You certainly have a way with pigs.</i>

264
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,155
Hello. I'm Harriet Putnam,
Bella Vista Farm.

265
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,198
- Oh, you have the fancy place down the road.
- That's right.

266
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,159
- This is my wife, Betty. Come on, honey.
- We've met already.

267
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,515
You're going to have a lovely place here
once you get it fixed up.

268
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,434
- It has loads of possibilities.
- Still needs a lot of work.

269
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,080
- Mind if I look around?
- Not at all. I'll show you around.

270
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,038
We've only just started
to get it in shape.

271
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,715
It's going to be so nice having
real people around for a change.

272
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,917
You better get cleaned up. That isn't
exactly perfume you're covered with.

273
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,636
Oh!

274
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,150
- How charming we look today, madam.
- We look nothing of the sort.

275
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,789
- Who are you?
- Best friend the farmer's wife ever had. Smiling Billy Reed.

276
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,077
<i>"Whatever you need,
see Billy Reed. " That's me.</i>

277
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,913
Right now I don't need anything except
a bath. Will you get out of my way...

278
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,514
For the bath. Soaps from the Orient,
perfumes from "Gay Paree. "

279
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,955
- Bath salts from the Isle of Capri.
- Some other time.

280
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,270
"Time," the lady says.
I got all the time in the world.

281
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,353
Alarm clocks, grandfather
clocks, wristwatches, pocket watches.

282
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,034
If it's time you need, see Billy Reed...

283
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,908
"If at first you don't succeed, try again,"
says Billy Reed.

284
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,639
- Please, I've got to change my clothes!
- "Clothes," the lady says.

285
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,473
Yes, I know. If it's clothes you need,
see Billy Reed.

286
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,597
I don't want any.
Now, will you go away?

287
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,717
<i>You can turn me down
and send me away, but I'll be back...</i>

288
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,109
another day!

289
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,598
<i>Oh, isn't he nice? Is he ours?</i>

290
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,433
Yeah, I bought him from Doc Wilson.

291
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,149
- Hi!
- He's a wonderful hunting dog, but he's vicious.

292
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,277
- Oh, he doesn't look...
- Don't touch him! He's bitten about everybody in town.

293
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,239
- Honest?
- Doc said he took a piece out of two postmen and three delivery boys.

294
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,039
I'll just tie him up front here
till I build a run for him.

295
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,759
- Don't want to get him
too near the livestock.

296
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,910
- What's his name?
- Sport.

297
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,436
- Hiya, Sport.
- Betty, don't touch him. I tell you he's dangerous.

298
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,636
Takes a steady nerve
to handle a dog like this.

299
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,393
- Better leave him to me
and stay away from him.

300
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,436
He looks
awfully sweet to me.

301
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,635
Women.

302
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,349
- What on Earth is that?
- Hello. I didn't hear you come in.

303
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,558
It's just a contraption I rigged up.
Kind of an automatic feeder.

304
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,838
The chicken pokes its head in there and
then the grain will just naturally pour out.

305
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,879
- I hope.
- Did you invent that?

306
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,235
There's a couple of things
I have to figure out.

307
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,790
- You're a regular Thomas Edison.
- Not quite.

308
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,997
I just like to tinker around
with machines and things.

309
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,038
- Better than farming?
- Oh, much.

310
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,714
Put 'er there.
I'll tell you something.

311
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,759
I like anything better than farming,
especially chicken farming.

312
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,308
- It's not much fun.
- It's no fun at all.

313
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,278
- You better let me.
- Oh, would you?

314
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,920
They don't care
very much about me.

315
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,913
- Shouldn't you be in school today?
- I finished school last year.

316
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,356
Oh, I see.

317
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,433
- What are you going to do now?
- Oh, I don't know.

318
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:49,150
- This or that, I guess. Doesn't make much difference.
- Doesn't it?

319
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,597
I sort of hoped I could go to college.
Study engineering or something.

320
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,830
But there's
not much chance of that.

321
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,469
- Why not?
- A lot of reasons.

322
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,949
For one, Ma needs somebody
around the place.

323
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:06,113
- You know how Pa is.
- Yes, I know how he is.

324
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,951
And, I'm the oldest, so...
Well, anyway...

325
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,749
- Here.
- Thanks.

326
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,753
Think I'll have a talk
with Ma one of these days.

327
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,954
Oh! Oh, no!

328
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,475
Well, well, well.

329
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,189
Well, hello,
Mr Vicious.

330
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,794
Bob's going to be awfully disappointed
when he comes home...

331
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,474
and finds out you haven't
torn me to pieces.

332
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,870
Did you want to show me
what a great retriever you are, huh?

333
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,272
Is that it? Come on.

334
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,797
Oh, you old fraud.
You don't even retrieve, do you?

335
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,873
Okay.

336
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,590
All right, we won't
tell Bob. No, we won't.

337
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,514
We'll just let him dream
a little while longer.

338
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,190
- Get in.
- Oh, I'm only going as far as the Kettles.

339
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,989
- I'll drop you. Get in.
- Thank you.

340
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,877
I'm Mrs Hicks, the oldest family
in the county. That's my mother.

341
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,158
- How do you do? How are you?
- Fine, considering my condition.

342
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,232
- I'm so sorry. Aren't you feeling well?
- Never had a sick day.

343
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:56,110
- It's all in her mind.
- Don't you go saying that, Birdie. I've got complications.

344
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,478
Doctor Wilson says he never came across a
case like mine in his whole medical practice...

345
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,997
Pa Kettle been borrowing things
from ya already? Never get it back.

346
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,277
Lazy, shiftless crew, the whole lot of'em.
Disgrace to the community.

347
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,592
I went to the city last year and had
a wonderful going-over by a doctor there.

348
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,638
You the young couple took that abandoned
farm up the mountains a ways?

349
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,597
- It wasn't exactly abandoned. We bought it...
- He said to me...

350
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,195
"I don't ever remember seeing
a liver quite like yours. "

351
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,352
Nobody else wanted it. I call that
abandoned. Whatever you buy it for?

352
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,874
- He gave me the most wonderful pills.
- You'll never get it...

353
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,916
to look like anything,
too rundown.

354
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,754
I still got some. I'll send a few over to you
if there's anything the matter.

355
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,753
As for farming, be nothing short
of a miracle if you get anything to grow.

356
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,638
Better folks than you
have tried it and failed.

357
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:48,509
Eyesore to the community. I've tried
my best to get them run out of the county.

358
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,875
- Sure you want to stop off here?
- Positive.

359
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,669
You must come over sometime and let me tell
you all about the time I went to the hospital.

360
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,275
- Can't say you weren't warned.
- Thanks for the lift.

361
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,748
Give me mine! Give me it!

362
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,317
- Hello!
- Oh, hello. How are you?

363
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,675
Fine.

364
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,718
- Hello!
- Hi.

365
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,430
# Seesaw, seesaw,
Margery Daw, seesaw #

366
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,957
Where's your mother?

367
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,870
<i># Seesaw ##</i>

368
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,555
Stop that dad-blasted noise!
Clear outta here!

369
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,995
<i>Go on, you!</i>

370
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,117
- Well, hello. Ain't this nice?
- How are you?

371
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,079
I was just wondering how long it'd be
before you got so lonesome you'd visit.

372
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,835
- Come on in the kitchen where we can talk a spell.
- Thank you.

373
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:22,471
<i>Shoo, shoo! Get out of here!</i>

374
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,393
Go! Go!
Get out of here.

375
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,870
My, my,
don't you look fine?

376
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,555
- Take a seat and make yourself to home.
- Thank you.

377
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,712
<i>Just throw that stuff
anywhere.</i>

378
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,472
How do you like your new place?
You don't look like a farmer.

379
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,757
I'm not, I'm afraid,
but I'm learning.

380
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,789
Nothin' like it, if it don't kill ya.
You're staying for dinner naturally.

381
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,519
<i>- Oh, no, thank you.
- Oh, of course, you will.</i>

382
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,912
Enough here for an army. Now, if you'll
just give me a hand settin' the table.

383
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,719
Oh, surely.

384
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,758
Tom was tellin' me what
real nice people you was.

385
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,673
We think a lot of him too.
He's a good boy, and he's so clever.

386
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,911
Ain't he, though? Not a mite like
the rest of the Kettles.

387
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,675
Makes me...
wonder sometimes.

388
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:17,072
<i>- Seems a shame he had to leave school.
- Well, you know how it is.</i>

389
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:21,472
We need Tom around the place.
Pa ain't much for workin' and...

390
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,394
<i>- The rest of the young'uns
seem to take right after him.</i>

391
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,713
Well... just the same
he ought to go to college.

392
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,475
<i>College! What fer?</i>

393
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,717
Oh, just so he can
make something of himself.

394
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,917
You wouldn't want to watch him
go to seed around here, would you?

395
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,310
<i>Of course not.
Ain't for me to say.</i>

396
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,676
If he had a little help, he could make out
all right at the State University.

397
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,035
There's no tuition
and he could work.

398
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,398
- He been talkin' to ya?
- He wants to go so badly.

399
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,519
Yes, I know he does.
I can see it in his eyes.

400
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,229
Tom got real high marks
when he was in high school.

401
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,518
- Ain't much I can do about it.
- Well, it's too bad.

402
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,830
<i>Don't know as I could
get along without Tom.</i>

403
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,799
We ain't got a live buck in the house
except what he brings in.

404
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:21,034
Last money I saved up, Pa put in a couple of
minks he was going to breed and make us a fortune.

405
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,908
Only they up and died before
they got around to breedin'.

406
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,389
Pa's kind of a dreamer
that way.

407
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,109
If you'll just get hold of that bell, we'll
let the varmints know dinner's ready.

408
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,191
Oh, sure.

409
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,232
You better stay out
of that doorway, honey...

410
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,470
<i>- before you get trompled on.
- What?</i>

411
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,358
<i>You better stay out of that doorway!</i>

412
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,830
Howdy.

413
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,277
Just sit yourself down anywheres, honey.
We don't stand on no ceremonies.

414
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,114
Henry, move over. Let the lady in.
Where's your manners?

415
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,636
Henry, move over and give
the lady a place to sit.

416
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,077
I ain't Henry, Ma. I'm Albert.
That's Henry, remember?

417
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,516
Whatever your name is,
move over and give the lady a seat.

418
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,309
Just make yourself
comfortable, honey.

419
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,119
Okay, Pa.

420
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,799
Much obliged
for everything.

421
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,829
<i>- Hey, Betty, what's this?
- My kitchen garden. I told you about it.</i>

422
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,229
You didn't tell me
you were going to put it here.

423
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,517
- What's the matter with here?
- Nothing, except when it rains.

424
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,832
- The water's gonna come over that embankment in sheets.
- That's why I put it here.

425
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,230
- So it would get plenty of water.
- Have it your own way.

426
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,392
Come on, get dressed. We're gonna have
lunch at Harriet Putnam's, remember?

427
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,357
<i>- Do we have to?
- Yep.</i>

428
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,872
It certainly is
a beautiful layout.

429
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,713
Betty, maybe one of these days
we can have something like this.

430
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,839
- If we ever get a contract for our eggs.
- I could speak to Mr Henty.

431
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,595
He's the agent for Great Western Markets
out here. They buy all my dairy products.

432
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:53,434
I'd appreciate it. We're at the stage
where we can handle a steady contract.

433
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,399
I'll talk to him. He does almost anything
I ask him to do.

434
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,632
<i>- He's such a dear.
- Ayoung man, I take it?</i>

435
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,633
Ah, he used to be.
He's a little crotchety now, I'm afraid.

436
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,756
Besides, he has a wife.

437
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,594
Ha, those were
the old rules.

438
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,194
- Do you think we could go outside and look around?
- Oh, of course.

439
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,192
I love to show it off.
Just wait 'til we get to the barn...

440
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,555
and I show you
my Speckled Sussex.

441
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,950
- Her what?
- Speckled Sussex.

442
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,759
- That's a breed of hen. Very special too.
- Oh.

443
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,514
It's my theory an egg-raising flock ought
to be kept at 96% lay most of the year.

444
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,994
<i>- I've got a headache.
- What do you think, Harriet?</i>

445
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,719
<i>Well, of course,
so much depends on the breed.</i>

446
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,836
- I've got a headache!
- Huh?

447
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,390
- I've got a headache. I think I'd like to go home.
- That's too bad.

448
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,155
- Wouldn't you like to take something and lie down?
- No, I'd like to go home.

449
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,993
- Sort of hoping we could look around a little more.
- You can stay.

450
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,275
I can get home by myself.
I'm sure Miss Putnam...

451
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:02,672
will be only too glad to drive you home...
when she's through with you.

452
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,514
- I'm sorry we have to rush off like this.
- I understand.

453
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,433
Drop in sometime when you're driving by.
You haven't seen anything yet.

454
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,671
- I'll do that. Don't forget about Mr Henty.
- I won't.

455
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,158
- I do hope you'll feel better.
- Thanks.

456
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,597
- Do you have these headaches often?
- Often enough.

457
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,593
- Very interesting. Goodbye.
- Bye!

458
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:42,191
- Do you find Harriet attractive?
- She knows a lot about chickens.

459
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,875
If that's how you measure your women,
where does that leave me?

460
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,715
You don't have to know about chickens
to be attractive. A lot of women don't.

461
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,588
When I think of the years I spent learning
how to be irresistible to my husband.

462
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,875
All you have to do
is cackle.

463
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,950
- I wonder if she could.
- Could what? Cackle?

464
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,794
No. Take you
away from me.

465
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,678
- Don't be an idiot.
- It's happened, you know.

466
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,833
Men have no sense at all when it
comes to women. Babes in arms.

467
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:19,038
- Will you stop? I can take care of myself.
- Every man has his danger point.

468
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,112
Just get beyond it and...
he's a goner.

469
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,192
- Don't talk like that.
- It's true.

470
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,592
Your danger point might happen
to be Harriet Putnam's beautiful house...

471
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,800
and all that expensive farm machinery
and those fat Hereford cows...

472
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,075
touched by no human hand,
poor things.

473
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,628
I am not interested in Harriet Putnam's
beautiful house...

474
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,188
or her farm machinery
or her cows.

475
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,636
I'm only interested
in chickens and, uh, you.

476
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,188
<i>Oh, look out!</i>

477
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,435
<i>Oh, now look what you've done.</i>

478
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:03,753
<i>What's that?</i>

479
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,113
That is a flat tyre.

480
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,514
It isn't enough
to go in the ditch.

481
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,594
- What are we going to do now?
- We're going to change it.

482
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,069
Oh. Well.

483
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,109
- Lucky I got some new equipment or
we really would be stuck. - Mm-hmm.

484
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,234
- That's funny.
- What are you looking for?

485
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,835
- The jack!
- Is that it?

486
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,913
No, that's a wrench.
Don't you know the difference?

487
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,790
Oh, is a jack that kind of funny-looking
thing that goes up and down?

488
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,839
- Yes, that's it.
- Oh, that.

489
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,674
- Where is it?
- I... used it yesterday...

490
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,558
to prop open
the kitchen door.

491
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,349
You see, Sport was...

492
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,671
- It's probably there now.
- Uh-huh.

493
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,274
All we need now to make
the day perfect is for it to rain.

494
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,077
<i>You had to open your big mouth.</i>

495
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,434
Bob! My garden!

496
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,754
- Don't say it! You told me so!
- It's too bad, honey.

497
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,752
Bob, we've got to get away
from here before it's too late.

498
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,469
They don't want us here. The mountains,
rain, wind, they don't want us here!

499
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,120
- They're fighting us all the time!
- Stop it.

500
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,716
- It'll be all right.
- We've got to get away before we lose everything!

501
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,951
- Before we lose each other!
- Betty!

502
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:34,192
Betty, wait!

503
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,833
"Stir rapidly. "

504
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:20,680
"... rapidly... and drop
gently into pot. "

505
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,830
Well.

506
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:40,077
- Betty, where are my guns?
- In the closet.

507
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,355
- What's the matter? What?
- Cougar!

508
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,797
- A cougar!
- What's that?

509
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,872
Something like a lion.
Very dangerous.

510
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,110
- Oh.
- He's in the woods back of the barn.

511
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,158
Crowbar and Geoduck
just told me. They saw him.

512
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,879
- What are you gonna do?
- Shoot him!

513
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,556
- Why? Won't he go away?
- No, he's after the livestock.

514
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,915
Oh.

515
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,117
Maybe if you'd just
leave him alone, he'd disappear.

516
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,192
Cougars don't disappear.
You have to shoot 'em!

517
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,431
Here you are, Crowbar.
Now we'll get Sport.

518
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,990
He's a great hunting dog. Be a wonderful
chance to see how he works.

519
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:22,073
<i>- Look at him, he's raring to go.
He's got the scent already.</i>

520
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,472
- Stand aside when I let him out.
He's pretty wild.

521
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,394
All right, boy, after him! Hey, Sport!

522
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,870
<i>- Sport, this way! Sport, where are you going?
- Bob!</i>

523
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,791
<i>- Hey, Sport!
- Bob!</i>

524
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,633
<i>- Where is he?
- He's under the stove! What is it, the cougar?</i>

525
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,871
- No, it's Sport. Sport, come on, boy.
- Sport?

526
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,428
Come on, we're
going hunting. Cougar!

527
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,637
<i>Sport, come on, boy. Come on, Sporty.</i>

528
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,712
Sport, come out of there!

529
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,998
All right, stay there.
That dog is... is dishonest.

530
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,868
Okay, it's safe now.

531
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,155
You can come out.

532
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,634
Bob! Bob!

533
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,598
Bob, they're here!
Hurry up!

534
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,638
Oh, oh.

535
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,713
Oh, you little darlings you.
Oh, aren't they cute!

536
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,758
- What's happened? What's the matter?
- Look, millions of them!

537
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,831
Aren't they wonderful?

538
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,869
- Be careful, they injure very easily.
- Wait 'til Mr Henty sees.

539
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,272
I'll bet he'll get us the biggest egg
contract in the county.

540
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:44,148
- Oh, do we have to name them all?
- They're not pets, you know.

541
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,913
They're our stock in trade. If they
don't get jammed under the brooder...

542
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,753
and smother or drown in the drinking
fountain or get coccidiosis...

543
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,628
or peck each other to death,
we may be in the chicken business yet.

544
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,757
If you feel that way about them,
why not drown 'em all now?

545
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:01,550
After you've fed and watered them every three
hours until they can take care of themselves...

546
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,710
you won't feel
so sentimental about them.

547
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:13,150
If you kids had any sense, you'd go
right back where you came from.

548
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,831
- What are you doing?
- I'm cutting down a tree.

549
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,959
- Whatever for? It's a lovely tree.
- To clear space for the new chicken house.

550
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,396
Oh, don't you think it's kind of awful
to cut down a tree?

551
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,395
We're not running a park here. Stand over
there so the chips don't fly in your face.

552
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:40,315
- Won't it fall on the chicken house?
- No, no, dear, it won't.

553
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,075
Looks like it to me.

554
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,436
Darling, you take care of the kitchen
and I'll take care of the tree.

555
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,990
I just thought,
that's all.

556
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,629
Honey, it just so happens that I spent
a whole summer in a logging camp once.

557
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,554
I've watched experts
fall tree after tree.

558
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,517
Just the same.

559
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:07,070
Look, dear, this isn't a matter of guesswork.
It's a matter of science.

560
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:11,312
It's a question of leverages, weights and
balances which I've worked out to the nth degree.

561
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,598
The tree isn't going to fall on the chicken
house. It's going to fall right there.

562
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,274
If you don't believe it,
just wait and see.

563
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:22,990
If you don't mind, I'll wait in the house
where I'll be safe.

564
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,829
<i>Timber!</i>

565
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,191
No! No! No!

566
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,232
Bob? Bob!

567
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:01,552
Bob, where are you?
Where are you, Bob?

568
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,310
Oh!

569
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,119
Timber!

570
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,919
Very funny.

571
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,713
<i>Is that you, Bob? Dinner's ready.</i>

572
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,711
<i>Be there in a minute.</i>

573
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,316
Oh, Bob.

574
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:26,035
I hope I'm not late.
Happy Tuesday.

575
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:29,715
- Oh, thanks to you and many of them.
- I like your gown.

576
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,588
- Have I seen it before?
- Yes, I wear it at all my weddings.

577
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,956
- Where would you like to dine?
- Wherever you say.

578
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,508
There's the Palace Hotel in San Francisco.
Wonderful food.

579
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,353
Or Antoine's in New Orleans
if you like bouillabaisse.

580
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,716
- Or we might hop over to New York and try "21."
- Yes, let's try "21."

581
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,598
All right. Oh, Mac,
you have a table for us?

582
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:51,797
This one right here?
This is our table here.

583
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:56,237
Wonderful-looking food,
and a wonderful-looking chef.

584
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,633
- An excellent dinner. My compliments.
- Thank you.

585
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,951
- Shall we go dancing?
- I wouldn't mind.

586
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:15,476
- The Stork Club's just around the corner.
- That sounds fine.

587
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,748
- I'll have the orchestra play something special.
- All right.

588
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,276
Oh, darling, thanks
for a wonderful evening.

589
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,910
- You the folks that live here?
- Why, yes.

590
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,991
Well, I'm Henty,
Great Western Markets.

591
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:13,234
Henty? Oh, Mr Henty.
It's Mr Henty.

592
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:17,791
- How do you do, Mr Henty?
- Knocked on the front door, nobody answered.

593
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,316
So I come around by the back way.
Interrupting something, am I?

594
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,632
No, my wife and I were just,
uh... Oh, this is my wife.

595
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,518
How do you do, Mr Henty?
We were just celebrating...

596
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,194
- our anniversar...
- Birthday...

597
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,511
- I see. Maybe I better make it another time.
- Oh, don't go.

598
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,194
- We're all through, aren't we, Bob?
- Of course, we are.

599
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,078
Come and sit down.
We're certainly glad to see you.

600
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,038
- Sit down there.
- Well, just for a minute.

601
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:52,349
- Would you, uh, care for a cigar, Mr Henty?
- Never touch 'em.

602
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,159
- Bob, perhaps Mr Henty would like a drink.
- Of course.

603
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,550
- Don't touch that either.
- Oh, well...

604
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,870
we just keep it
around in case.

605
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,636
- Some people do, you know?
- So I've heard tell.

606
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:08,917
Oh, isn't this nice, your dropping in
on us like this, Mr Henty.

607
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,152
- We've heard so much about you.
- We certainly have.

608
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:16,835
I was over to Miss Putnam's.
Wonderful lady.

609
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,595
- Yes, wonderful.
- She's my dearest friend.

610
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:24,912
- She told me you people might have some eggs to sell.
- That's right, we have.

611
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,798
Thought I'd drop 'round on
the way home, look things over.

612
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:31,509
Mighty glad you did.
We're not up to full production yet...

613
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,309
<i>- but be glad to show you the layers we have.
- Won't be necessary.</i>

614
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,756
I judge my eggs by the people
that produce 'em.

615
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:42,310
"Like chicken, like master,"
I always say.

616
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,838
When I was a little girl...

617
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,229
I got seven medals for perfect attendance
at Sunday school.

618
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,550
<i>- Didn't I, Bob?
- Yes!</i>

619
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:56,156
Yes, she did. That's the...
main reason I married her.

620
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,677
I was an Eagle Scout myself.

621
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,320
- Well...
- You're not going to leave us so soon.

622
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:07,439
- It's early. You just got here.
- Don't believe in folks staying up too late.

623
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,875
- "Early to bed, early to rise... "
- "Makes a man...

624
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,951
healthy, wealthy
and wise. "

625
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,237
<i>- How right you are.
- Where's my hat?</i>

626
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:18,790
<i>It's right over there...</i>

627
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,155
Sport! I'll get it.

628
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,708
Sport, get off.

629
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:28,669
Very friendly dog.
He likes to sit on hats.

630
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:32,116
Here, I'll fix it.

631
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:36,273
Never mind,
I'll do it.

632
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,230
How many dozen eggs do you think
you'll be needing per week?

633
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:48,199
- Any idea?
- I don't know.

634
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:51,636
Got to think it over.
Goodnight.

635
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,269
- Goodnight, Mr Henty.
- Goodnight, Mr Henty. Come again.

636
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:06,470
- Well, that's the end of Mr Henty.
- Yeah.

637
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:10,030
- Gonna have to eat
an awful lot of omelets.

638
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:15,751
Oh, why did he have to show up tonight?

639
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:18,434
Oh, well.

640
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:24,353
Hey, I just remembered.
I never did carry you over the threshold.

641
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,876
That's right, you didn't.
Oh, just a minute.

642
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,397
Now.

643
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:46,075
Send up another batch of them nails,
and I figure we'll be all set.

644
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,754
- Okay, drop 'er down.
- There she goes.

645
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,718
Say, is Ma home?

646
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,758
<i>- I've got business with her.
- That's where I left her.</i>

647
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:04,591
- All right, take it away.
- Up she goes.

648
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,592
Betty, how do you like it?
All set up and ready to go.

649
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,513
You'll have water in the kitchen any
minute now. All we have to do is fill it up.

650
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,398
- Think it'll work?
- Oh, sure. Pa's an expert on water tanks.

651
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,948
He may not know about anything else,
but he knows about water tanks.

652
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:19,476
<i>He says.</i>

653
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:22,438
Hello!

654
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,959
<i>- Bob, I need your help.
- What's the matter?</i>

655
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:32,272
Just about everything. My generator
broke down and everything is stopped.

656
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:37,480
The cows haven't been milked. The chickens
can't be fed. My dairy products are ruined.

657
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:40,120
My foreman hasn't the slightest idea
what to do about it.

658
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,954
- I can leave here for a while. I'll come over.
- Would you?

659
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:47,157
Why don't you get Tom Kettle?
He's a genius with machinery.

660
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:51,438
I couldn't possibly trust him.
He's such a boy. This is a man's job.

661
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,557
I see what you mean.

662
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,679
Uh-huh.

663
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:01,228
- Be back for lunch.
- Goodbye.

664
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,197
Bye.

665
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,311
<i>Hello!</i>

666
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,075
<i>Come right on in!
Don't stand on no ceremony.</i>

667
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:16,470
<i>- Come on in!
- I came to bring you something. It's a present.</i>

668
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,472
- For me?
- Yep.

669
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:24,588
- Jiminy whizz!
- I made it myself. Do you like it?

670
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:28,275
Drat my hide and call me a possum.
Ain't this somethin'?

671
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:31,716
I thought you might like to wear it
at the dance tonight, so I rushed it.

672
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,554
- You might have to do over a couple of the seams.
- I ain't never been so surprised.

673
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:38,996
First new dress I've had
since way back before the war.

674
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:43,119
- Stylish too, ain't it? - You'll
be the best-dressed girl at the ball.

675
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:47,716
- Can't imagine why you went to all this trouble for me.
- It's no trouble, it's fun.

676
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,429
- Get some of them cookies and I'll pour some coffee.
- All right.

677
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:59,754
Oh, I'm so sorry.

678
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:04,914
Pay it no mind. Just leave it.
Might as well be one place as another.

679
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,549
Come on, get away.

680
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,837
When I was first married, I was
as neat as the next woman.

681
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,480
Tried to keep my house
and kids clean.

682
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:18,838
But Pa's an awful
old lazy so-and-so.

683
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:23,948
It was fight, fight, fight all the time,
so finally give it up.

684
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:28,830
I can't make Pa change and be neat,
so I'll have to change and be dirty.

685
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:33,357
Been peace in this house ever since.
There, ain't this pretty?

686
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,353
- It's perfectly beautiful.
- Made one every year since I was married.

687
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,954
Got 'em in the closet
in the spare room.

688
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:44,033
Figured it'd be something real nice
to leave the kids when I die.

689
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,829
Why don't you enter it
in the county fair?

690
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,913
- Oh, you should! It's a wonderful idea.
- What in tarnation fer?

691
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,673
You might win first prize.
You could give the money to Tom.

692
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:58,469
- He could enter college. Wouldn't that be grand?
- 'Tain't no use.

693
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,870
Birdie Hicks will win.
She wrangles things around every year...

694
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,599
so one of her relations gets on
the committee that judges them.

695
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:09,390
- You could try.
- I've got a better idea.

696
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:13,598
- When it's finished, I'm givin' it to you.
- Oh, no, I couldn't.

697
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:17,639
Oh, I got a whole parcel of'em laid away.
There ain't nobody I'd rather see have it.

698
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:21,110
- Oh!
- Take another one of them cookies, why don't ya?

699
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,954
Plenty where they come from.
I'll get you some to take home.

700
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,076
They're wonderful.
How do you make 'em?

701
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:30,197
Just a drop of this
and a drop of that.

702
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,670
<i>- Mix it together
and shove it in the oven.</i>

703
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,150
- You home already? 'Tain't near feeding time.
- Got your water tank up.

704
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,879
<i>- Be havin' running water any minute now.
- Oh, thanks.</i>

705
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:43,555
- That'll be a relief.
- Never see the sense of running water in the house.

706
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:46,598
Rather get mine straight out of
the ground where the good Lord put it.

707
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:49,752
I don't hold with too much water anyhow.
Rusts the bones.

708
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:53,310
Well, I'll chance it.
Thank you, goodbye.

709
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,597
Mighty fine of you to make me
that dress, honey. I appreciate it.

710
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:00,036
I got the best of the trade.
It doesn't hold a candle to your quilt.

711
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,554
<i>- See you at the party tonight!
- You bet.</i>

712
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,838
<i>- Hello there!
- Hello!</i>

713
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,717
- Oh, hello.
- Hiya, kids!

714
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:30,157
- How do I look? Hey! Get out of there.
- Perfect!

715
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,232
<i>- Don't you folks want something to eat?
- Not just now.</i>

716
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:38,678
I always brings my own vittles to these
shindigs. Don't like strangers feeding us.

717
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,228
Now where'd he disappear to?
William!

718
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:44,869
What are ya doin' up there?
Didn't I tell you to behave?

719
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,430
- We'll see you later.
- Hey!

720
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:59,359
- Oh, sorry.
- Well, greetings. Isn't this quaint?

721
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,193
- You remember Mr Henty?
- Oh, yes, we've met.

722
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,589
I've been working on Mr Henty
to give you that egg contract.

723
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,989
- I've got him practically to the signing point.
- Oh?

724
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:10,755
A recommendation from
Mrs Putnam goes a long way.

725
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,877
Of course, we're not taking on
any new obligations these days.

726
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:17,270
Don't worry, it's in the bag.

727
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,717
- Quite a character.
- Yes, isn't he?

728
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,995
- I mean her.
- Oh, she's all right.

729
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:26,356
Mighty nice of her to go to all that trouble.
Could sure use that contract.

730
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,474
- Hello!
- Oh, hello. How do you feel?

731
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:35,712
- Terrible. This is my doctor.
- This is my husband.

732
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:38,712
Big, isn't he?

733
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:42,156
- Who was that?
- Mrs Hicks' mother. She's an invalid.

734
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,754
Doing all right for an invalid.

735
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:53,510
- Oh, no.
- Oh, I'm sorry. We were just...

736
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:57,434
- Oh, my heavens.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mr Henty.

737
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,636
- We were just...
- Never mind!

738
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:03,269
I'll wipe it myself.

739
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,439
There goes the egg contract.

740
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:11,718
You're not helping much.
I'll see what I can do.

741
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,189
Oh.

742
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:18,876
You shouldn't have done that to Mr Henty.
He's a very fine man and a leading citizen.

743
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,032
- We didn't do it on purpose.
- One thing we don't stand for at these affairs...

744
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:24,429
and that's roughhouse.

745
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:28,433
- If you want to stay here, you'd better behave.
- I'll keep an eye on him.

746
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:31,717
- See that you do.
- Here, try one of these.

747
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:36,749
- They look delicious.
- They ought to. Don't you recognize her?

748
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,952
- Oh! You mean it's...
- It's Cleopatra.

749
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:44,999
It's our donation. What's the matter?
Aren't you going to eat it?

750
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:48,356
What do you think I am,
a cannibal?

751
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,876
- Well! Glad to see ya.
- Hello, Pa.

752
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,190
- What'll it be?
- Oh, some of the same.

753
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,953
Got somethin'
a little better than the same.

754
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:08,749
Just, uh,
try that for size.

755
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:13,470
Made it myself. Fresh out of the still
this afternoon. None of that old stuff.

756
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:27,478
- Is my head still on?
- I can't see it anyplace.

757
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,596
- Oh, Bob.
- Yipe.

758
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:32,558
- Are you took?
- What?

759
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,074
- Are you took?
- He wants to dance.

760
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,951
I'm sorry, I'm engaged.

761
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:45,715
Betty, at affairs like this you're supposed
to dance with anybody that asks you.

762
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:49,759
- Otherwise they'll say you're a snob.
- Are you ready?

763
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:53,389
Ah. Yes.

764
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:38,557
Betty doesn't seem to be able to find
a partner that fits her.

765
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,757
- I better rescue her.
- Get me a cold drink first, please.

766
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:44,798
- I'm dying of thirst.
- Well...

767
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:56,628
I certainly had a hard time getting to you.
You're the most popular girl.

768
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,836
It's an honour
I'd gladly give up.

769
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:02,993
I've been pushed and pulled around this floor.
I don't know whether I'm coming or going.

770
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:06,197
You wouldn't like to sit this one out,
would you, and give my feet a rest?

771
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:08,874
Oh, sure, I'll get you
something to drink.

772
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,714
- May I?
- Oh, must you? Couldn't you some other time?

773
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:15,155
"Never put off until tomorrow
what you can do today,"

774
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:18,596
Billy Reed's motto
in work or play.

775
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:28,275
- Think we could slow down a bit?
- Follow the lead with Billy Reed.

776
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:31,989
If I have any feet left.
Oh, thank heavens.

777
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,559
- Don't you ever get tired?
- Vitamin pills.

778
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:40,791
- Yeah, I know, you sell them.
- Greatest little item I handle.

779
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,839
I don't want any. I'd rather wear out
in my own way.

780
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:47,559
I've got to get out of here
while I can still walk.

781
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:52,031
I admire you tremendously.
You're one in a million.

782
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:55,317
- Greatest sales resistance I ever met up with.
- Oh, thanks.

783
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:59,712
- It's no effort at all.
- Try and resist if you can, but Billy Reed will get his man.

784
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,678
But I'm not a man.

785
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,998
<i>- How's this?
- Fine.</i>

786
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,958
<i>Ah, Bob, can't we talk
about something besides chickens?</i>

787
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,429
<i>- All right, what'll it be?
- What about you?</i>

788
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:23,318
- Do you like your farm?
- Oh, sure.

789
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,278
And, Betty, does she like
being a farmer's wife?

790
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,920
<i>She likes it fine.
It was rough at first.</i>

791
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,434
<i>But she's getting
used to it.</i>

792
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:35,638
Men are such fools about women.
They invariably marry the wrong one.

793
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:38,632
<i>- I wouldn't say that.
- All my husbands did.</i>

794
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,875
- Oh, Bob, darling, are you hurt?
- No, but...

795
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:51,635
Party's getting rough.
I think we better go in.

796
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:03,877
- Harriet, would you excuse me?
- Of course. See you later.

797
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:20,716
Getting some air?

798
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:23,394
How long have you
been out here?

799
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:26,392
I just came out this minute.
It was awfully hot in there.

800
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:29,870
- Having a good time?
- Somebody hit me on the head with this shoe.

801
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:33,714
- No. What for?
- Just trying to be funny, I guess.

802
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:37,395
Oh, for heaven's sake.

803
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:41,632
Oh, don't do that.
It's mine!

804
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:45,076
- So it was you?
- Yes, now you go right out there and get it.

805
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:49,073
- What was the idea?
- Must be over in those bushes.

806
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:53,870
- I repeat, "What was the idea?"
- I didn't mean to hit you, honest.

807
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:57,839
- I meant to hit her. Did it hurt?
- Of course it hurt!

808
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,480
I don't see why you don't
like Harriet; she likes you.

809
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:03,757
- She said she admires you very much.
- Now she's saying nice things.

810
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:06,195
- That's just why I don't like her...
- You're being childish.

811
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:08,874
- I am not being childish!
- Shh!

812
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,838
That barnyard glamour girl
is setting a trap for you.

813
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,354
You're just goofy
enough to fall into it.

814
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:19,275
<i>You know, I don't like to point, but you're
beginning to make a noise like a jealous female.</i>

815
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:23,478
- This isn't becoming.
- What does she got that I haven't got?

816
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:26,552
- Except chickens.
- For one thing, she hasn't got me...

817
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:29,871
- as you seem to think.
- It's hardly noticeable.

818
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:33,873
You're not really serious about this?
You know better.

819
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:37,157
Every time I look around
you've got your heads together.

820
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:39,356
- It's getting monotonous.
- I should think you could trust me.

821
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:43,479
- In my book, a marriage without trust doesn't amount to much.
- I trust you.

822
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:47,155
- It's Miss Dreamy-puss I don't trust.
- Thanks for the confidence.

823
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:51,074
If I had a farm like hers with running water
and plumbing and electricity...

824
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:54,516
and machines to take care of the livestock,
I'd have more time to concentrate on you too.

825
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,830
So it isn't me you're
jealous about, it's her farm.

826
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:00,754
I'd like to see her carry water
from the well to the house.

827
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:04,594
What do you want to do, Betty, give up?
All you have to do is say the word.

828
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:07,114
When are we going to get a farm
like that, with machines and gadgets...

829
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:11,239
- and little men all over the place doing things?
- When we've earned it.

830
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:14,517
- Did she earn it?
- That's different. With her, her farm's a hobby.

831
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:18,832
With me, it's a cause. I want to carve it
out of rock with my bare hands.

832
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:23,550
And mine, don't forget.
Just look at them.

833
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:26,996
You'd never believe they used to get
a manicure twice a week.

834
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:31,631
- Never did anything rougher than play the piano.
- They're being a lot more useful.

835
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:36,236
- You should be very proud of them.
- I've got a great idea.

836
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:39,471
Why don't you poison me and marry her?
You'd make a wonderful husband for her.

837
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,869
Fine!
I like that.

838
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:46,670
We could spend our honeymoon
in the electric chair, thinking about you.

839
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,317
<i>Attention, folks. Quiet, please.</i>

840
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:54,676
Sheriff Drum is here to make
a very important announcement.

841
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:58,116
We better go see what's up.

842
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,031
But what about my shoe?

843
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:03,955
I don't like interruptin',
but we've got trouble.

844
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:07,191
- Is Pa Kettle here?
- Right over this way, sir.

845
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:12,400
- Pa, you better get home. Your barn's on fire.
- Jehoshaphat.

846
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:16,155
I told you that still of yours would
blow up someday, and by golly, it did!

847
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:19,789
- Ma!
- We're comin', Pa! Tom!

848
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:23,998
<i>Here, Ma!</i>

849
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,674
That ain't all, folks.

850
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:31,038
A westerly wind blew up and carried
the flames to the woods just beyond.

851
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:36,558
Now, we've got a man-sized forest fire
on our hands, moving up the whole valley.

852
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:40,076
We did the best we could,
but it sort of got out of hand.

853
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:42,993
I suggest all you folks that have
homes up in that district...

854
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:46,197
<i>- that you get along.
- Come on, Betty.</i>

855
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:48,840
<i>We can use all the volunteers
that we can get.</i>

856
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:02,638
Looks pretty bad. We better
wet down the barn and chicken houses.

857
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:06,679
I'll get a shoe.

858
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:21,553
Lucky we built this tank. It'll give us
enough pressure to do some good.

859
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:24,108
Take it up to the barn.
We'll start on that first.

860
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:30,635
- Don't let it kink.
- No. Okay.

861
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:34,190
Here it comes.

862
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,996
Oh, Bob, look out!

863
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:02,033
Well, that's that. I guess
Pa can't build tanks either.

864
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:04,998
We could carry pails
of water from the well.

865
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:07,514
No, we couldn't do it
fast enough to do any good.

866
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,353
- You better get back to the house and start packing.
- Packing?

867
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:14,353
If the wind changes, we're a cooked goose.
We'd better be ready.

868
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:16,431
- I'll go get the animals out.
- Oh, Bob.

869
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:20,672
- Don't worry, honey. We'll manage.
- Sure we will.

870
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,871
- Wind's changin'!
- Comin' from the east!

871
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:44,158
- Headin' this way!
- Only thing can save you now is for it to rain.

872
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:47,471
- Doesn't look like it's going to.
- I better get back to the house.

873
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:50,836
- Sorry about that still.
- Couldn't be helped.

874
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:55,232
No use doing anything more here, men.
Thanks for your help anyway.

875
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:02,519
Get!

876
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:06,229
<i>Bob!</i>

877
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:10,029
<i>- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.</i>

878
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:13,476
- How is it?
- The wind shifted. If it doesn't rain, we'll be burned out.

879
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:17,394
- Do you think it will rain?
- Doesn't look like it.

880
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:22,634
<i>It'll be the only time it hasn't.</i>

881
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:25,359
We better finish packing,
get the truck loaded.

882
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:12,991
- Well, not very pretty, is it?
- It's awful.

883
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:17,153
Anyway it rained
before the house burned.

884
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:21,279
Something to be
thankful for.

885
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:25,069
Betty, this is it.
We're finished.

886
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:29,756
I wonder if Saddle, Finch, Tanner,
Pease and Stuck will take me back.

887
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:33,150
Not in
those clothes.

888
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:37,472
I'll have to dig out
the double-breasted with a pinstripe.

889
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:41,394
I think you look handsome
in the double-breasted with a pinstripe.

890
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:10,758
Certainly going to take a lot of building
to get this place going again.

891
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:14,719
Yeah, new barn,
new chicken house, new pigpen.

892
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,917
Plant a new orchard.
Gonna be a lot of work for somebody.

893
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,515
- When do we begin?
- "We"?

894
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,434
- I don't know who else, do you?
- Betty, you're crazy.

895
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:30,036
- I know when I'm licked.
- Just on account of a little fire?

896
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:34,989
What's the matter with you?
They built up Chicago after the fire.

897
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:38,675
And San Francisco.
If they can build up a couple of cities...

898
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:41,638
we ought to be able
to build up a chicken farm.

899
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:45,156
You mean you want to,
really?

900
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:48,516
- I want to, really.
- I don't want to quit either.

901
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:52,639
I'd never feel right about it.
I was just thinking about you.

902
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:58,193
- We're not going to quit.
- Oh, Betty.

903
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:02,831
I think you've outgrown
the double-breasted pinstripe anyway.

904
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:13,519
If that's Harriet Putnam, all I can say is,
she picked the wrong day!

905
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,990
No, it sounds like
something's up.

906
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,753
<i>You got yourselves pretty well
burned out last night.</i>

907
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:44,913
Livestock, buildings,
crops, most everything.

908
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,754
There's hardly one of us that hasn't
got more than he can use at this time.

909
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:54,119
So, we've gotten together to give you
whatever might be necessary to get you started.

910
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:57,954
<i>I don't want you young people to think
we've come here with charity.</i>

911
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,871
<i>Nothing of the sort.</i>

912
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:03,077
You took a bad beating
last night. No denying that.

913
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:06,675
But you're not the first,
and you won't be the last.

914
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:11,515
<i>We know that you're not foolish enough to
be feelin'sorry for yourselves this morning.</i>

915
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:17,951
<i>We've all had our share of troubles,
everybody that you see gathered here.</i>

916
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:22,836
<i>If it wasn't fire,
it was something else.</i>

917
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:28,074
<i>Sickness, death,
bad crops, one thing or another.</i>

918
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:32,438
<i>But that's the Lord's way.
I guess He knows what He's doing.</i>

919
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:37,275
Now, folks, I'm gonna call
your names off of this list.

920
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:41,069
I want you to reply and tell me
what you're going to give...

921
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:43,799
what your donation is.

922
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:47,156
Whether it's a couple of days
work or a jar of preserves.

923
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:51,438
Whatever it may be,
just speak right up. Mr Henty?

924
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:56,389
A two-year contract for
their entire output of eggs...

925
01:17:56,480 --> 01:18:00,314
<i>and a cash advance...
reasonable, of course.</i>

926
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,312
<i>- Mrs Putnam?
- One dozen Speckled Sussex hens.</i>

927
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:06,119
Mr and Mrs Asa Pettigrew?

928
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:09,158
Two suckling pigs
and corn to feed 'em!

929
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:11,071
<i>Jake Burnheimer and wife?</i>

930
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:14,709
Six bags of assorted seed
and the loan of my tractor.

931
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:18,793
<i>- The Burlaga family?
- Four Rhode Island layers and a rooster too.</i>

932
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:22,270
- Ma and Pa Kettle?
- Nine two-by-fours...

933
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:27,070
- three pounds of nails, hammer and a saw...
- And a quart of green paint.

934
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,276
And a quart of green paint.

935
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:36,036
<i>Hey, Betty, hurry up.</i>

936
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:40,591
<i>Here I am!</i>

937
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:43,956
All right, I'm coming.

938
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:47,396
- Just want to get there before the crowd.
- Yeah.

939
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:51,268
- I've never been to a county fair before.
- You haven't lived.

940
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:56,036
I'll never get a chance to if Ma Kettle finds
out I entered her quilt in the competition.

941
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:02,159
Come on, folks!

942
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:07,519
Hawaiian dancers from
the island of Hawaii!

943
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:23,639
<i>Hereford, shown by the Bella Vista Farm.</i>

944
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:27,235
<i>Beautiful animal. That's Harriet's.</i>

945
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:29,276
Quite a family resemblance,
don't you think?

946
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:32,238
<i>- Hello!
- Hello, Ma.</i>

947
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,550
- You two having yourselves a good time?
- Yes!

948
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:37,598
- Winning any prizes? - Not me. I
ain't entered and I ain't a-winnin'.

949
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:40,478
- Birdie Hicks just took the prize for her preserves.
- Oh.

950
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,869
Head judge is her cousin.

951
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,999
- Is he head judge of everything?
- If he ain't, some other cousin is.

952
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:52,313
There's a Hicks everywhere. Can't
fall down without landing on a Hicks.

953
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,073
- You staying here, or you want to look around?
- Sure.

954
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:57,913
My brood's scattered. Pa lit out
and I ain't seen hide nor hair of him.

955
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,515
I think I'll go with Ma.
I'm tired of cows, even Harriet's.

956
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,716
<i>- I'll catch you later, huh?
- Okay.</i>

957
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:07,156
<i>Hereford, three years old...
- Bob!</i>

958
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:09,708
- Hello. Isn't this fun?
- It certainly is.

959
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:12,758
- Who's going to win?
- I don't know. You're showing some mighty fine stock.

960
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:14,796
- Bonny Chance is a beauty, isn't she?
- You bet.

961
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,111
Come along to my box with me
and hold my hand. I'm so excited.

962
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:22,034
Are you having fun?

963
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:25,317
I ain't had so much fun since our Bessy
had a two-headed calf.

964
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:29,598
<i>- Ma, can I have a nickel?
- Elly, don't muss me.</i>

965
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:34,117
I give you a nickel a little while ago, didn't
I? Don't leap on this while it's a-goin'.

966
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:36,998
- You want to get killed?
- I'm not Elly, Ma. I'm Sally.

967
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,514
- You give Elly a nickel.
- Oh, so you are.

968
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:43,354
Land of Goshen, I thought you was Elly.
I'll give you a nickel.

969
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:48,514
Stretch it out for the rest of the day.
Didn't I tell you not to jump off?

970
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:53,720
Ain't young'uns a nuisance? Swear I
got so many, can't keep track of'em.

971
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:56,519
Just wait'll you have yourn.
You'll know what I mean.

972
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:59,717
- How many you countin' on?
- Just one to begin with.

973
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:02,473
But not for some time yet.
It's not on our schedule.

974
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:07,156
- Schedule? They havin' 'em
by schedule these days?

975
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:10,437
Land of Goshen,
what'll they think of next?

976
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,753
Hmm, say, we don't want
to be late for the prizes.

977
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:22,116
- You ain't gone and entered somethin', have ya?
- Oh, no.

978
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:25,397
- No, I'm just interested.
- Greetings, greetings, greetings.

979
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:28,870
Hello. My, are you really
as important as all that?

980
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,952
Vice president in charge
of practically the whole works.

981
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:34,713
- You don't say?
- Yeah, top man.

982
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:39,157
- Anything you need, ask Billy Reed.
- I'll see ya later, Ma.

983
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:42,232
- I've got some business to discuss with Mr Reed.
- You gonna buy something?

984
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:46,393
- You come along with me.
- Don't let him sell you nothin'.

985
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:49,677
First thing you know
he'll be makin' you pay first!

986
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:53,833
She certainly is a fine animal.

987
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:58,311
- You have a wonderful farm.
- Oh, I thought you didn't approve of my kind of farm.

988
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:03,076
I don't in principle, but in practice
it has a lot to be said for it.

989
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:08,029
Unfortunately, livestock and machinery
don't make a good farm.

990
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:11,635
- It does need a man.
- You've got men all over the place.

991
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:14,553
- I said "a" man!
- Oh.

992
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:17,996
I thought it would be so wonderful
to hide away from everybody...

993
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:22,153
and be a lady farmer,
but a prize Hereford is small solace...

994
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:25,437
on a cold winter evening,
I'm discovering.

995
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:28,478
That shouldn't be too hard
to remedy... for you.

996
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:32,269
- But all the best men are taken.
- Well, uh...

997
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:34,999
why don't you sell the farm?

998
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:37,958
- That the only solution?
- Well, it's one anyway.

999
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:42,959
Oh.

1000
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:47,158
- Tell me, uh, are you in the market for it?
- Oh, no.

1001
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:51,119
- It's way over my head.
- How can you tell till you've tried it?

1002
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:54,158
- How much would it take?
- Make an offer.

1003
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:58,199
- Well, I... I'd have to examine it.
- Oh, naturally.

1004
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:05,234
Maybe I could come out and see it
tomorrow. Will you be home?

1005
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:08,517
- Yes, but why not today?
- All right, I'll go and tell Betty that I'm going...

1006
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:11,114
Oh, don't be silly.
We'll be back before you're missed.

1007
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,316
- Jump in.
- Okay.

1008
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,551
- Shouldn't take long, should it?
- Not long at all.

1009
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:27,355
Ladies and gentlemen, the winner
of the patchwork quilt...

1010
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:30,034
annual competition,
Mrs Kettle.

1011
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:33,795
<i>First prize goes to Mrs Kettle.
Better known as Ma.</i>

1012
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:36,872
Well, hack me down.

1013
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:43,390
You can send over that portable
billiard table anytime you're ready.

1014
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:46,597
- Set of encyclopedias, don't forget.
- And encyclopedias.

1015
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:51,151
<i>- Ma, you won!
- Leapin' Lena, you went and entered that quilt I give ya.</i>

1016
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:54,835
- I told you you'd win.
- I can't understand it, with all them fine quilts.

1017
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:57,832
- Yours was the best, that's all.
- Hmph!

1018
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:01,037
Hello, how are you?
Oh, you don't look well.

1019
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,429
I never felt better
in all my life.

1020
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:05,590
Guess Birdie Hicks don't like me
takin' a prize away from her.

1021
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:08,638
Here's your ribbon
and your cheque.

1022
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:12,759
Which I will keep for you in full payment
on a brand new electric washing machine.

1023
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:16,799
- Something you can't do without.
- No, you don't either. This is for Tom.

1024
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,235
I just saw him.
Where... Just a minute.

1025
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:23,279
Tom! Tom!

1026
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:25,635
To... Oh.

1027
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:32,511
Tom!

1028
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:36,196
<i>Tom!</i>

1029
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:41,709
<i>Tom, what do you think?
Your mother's quilt won first prize.</i>

1030
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:45,076
- That's swell.
- Now you can go to college. Isn't that...

1031
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:48,596
- Oh, I...
- Oh, my.

1032
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,830
<i>She's fainted! Somebody get a doctor.</i>

1033
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:58,316
There now, honey,
you feelin' better?

1034
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:01,472
I sent Tom
to look for Bob.

1035
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:06,315
Oh, I can't imagine
what happened to me.

1036
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:10,518
I've never fainted
before in my life.

1037
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:14,354
You better stop in at Doc Wilson's
on the way back to town.

1038
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:17,796
- What for?
- Honey, you sure...

1039
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:21,793
you sure looked at
that schedule lately?

1040
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:23,757
Huh?

1041
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:58,910
Atta boy, that's a good fella.
Tonight's the night.

1042
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:27,672
Oh, now don't you start!

1043
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:32,038
<i>What do you want?</i>

1044
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:35,749
Sport!

1045
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:45,354
- Hello?
- May I come in?

1046
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,556
Of course, please do.
You just surprised me.

1047
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:50,154
I didn't hear
anybody drive up.

1048
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:53,550
- Hope I'm not disturbing you.
- Oh, good heavens, no.

1049
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:56,916
- I'm tickled to have someone around. Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

1050
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,436
My husband's been delayed,
and I hate being home alone.

1051
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:04,877
- Won't you have some coffee? I was just going to.
- That would be lovely.

1052
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:09,033
I don't seem to remember
seeing you anywhere.

1053
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:13,352
<i>No, we don't seem to get around
as much as we used to.</i>

1054
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:18,351
Albert and me keep pretty much
to ourselves these days.

1055
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:21,079
Don't we, dear?

1056
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:26,198
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, my.

1057
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:29,158
I don't believe you've met
my husband yet, have you?

1058
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:32,277
This is Albert.
He's so retiring.

1059
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:36,876
Sometimes people
just don't notice him at all.

1060
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:42,949
How do you do?

1061
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:52,151
Oh, my, don't they
look delicious though!

1062
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:54,879
Did you make them yourself?

1063
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:00,435
- Does he want any, do you think?
- Oh, no, dear.

1064
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:05,548
Albert never touches sweets.
Not good for his figure.

1065
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:09,076
Albert and me used to have
a chicken farm too, a long time ago.

1066
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:12,277
Didn't we, dear?
It was so nice.

1067
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:15,193
Everything was so happy
until Charlotte came.

1068
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:17,999
- You heard about Charlotte?
- No.

1069
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:21,117
Didn't ya? She was
just a plain, ordinary...

1070
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,668
little white leghorn
when she was hatched.

1071
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:26,752
But as time went on, she got bigger
and bigger and bigger and bigger...

1072
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:31,550
and bigger,
until she was this high.

1073
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:35,553
Higher than a man.

1074
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:39,633
That's when I begun
to notice she wasn't friendly.

1075
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:42,757
She used to look at Albert and me
as if she could peck us right to pieces.

1076
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:45,593
It made me nervous,
I can tell you.

1077
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:49,389
Once when I was getting into bed, I
heard a scratching noise and I looked up.

1078
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:53,359
There she was, staring
at me through the window.

1079
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:55,396
The wickedest look
in her eye you ever saw.

1080
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:58,711
Then one night, Albert and me
was sitting in the kitchen...

1081
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:03,191
having a cup of coffee, just like we are now,
when I heard a noise on the porch.

1082
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:06,750
Before we could take any notice of it,
there was a knock at the door.

1083
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,400
Knock, knock, knock.

1084
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,194
Oh, there you are, Emily.

1085
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:20,748
I thought I'd find you here.

1086
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:24,435
Hello, Sheriff.
I've been expecting you.

1087
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:28,308
You've been a bad girl again, Emily.

1088
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:37,270
Come along, Albert.
It's time to go back now.

1089
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:51,111
Thank you very much.
We've had a lovely visit.

1090
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:53,589
<i>You must drop in
and see us sometime.</i>

1091
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:59,999
She's a good soul.

1092
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:03,595
- Hope she didn't disturb you too much, ma'am.
- Oh, no.

1093
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:07,468
- I enjoyed every minute.
- Emily's harmless enough.

1094
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:10,870
She walks out once in a while.
It's up to us to come and fetch her.

1095
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:15,476
But it's never any trouble finding her.
She always comes to this place.

1096
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:18,791
- She used to live here.
- Sh-She lived here?

1097
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:21,792
Yes, she and her husband
used to raise chickens.

1098
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:23,836
Made a very nice thing
out of it too.

1099
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:26,912
Then one day Albert
ran off with another gal.

1100
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,639
We've never seen
hide nor hair of him since then.

1101
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:32,280
Drove poor Emily plumb loco.

1102
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:35,875
Well, goodnight, ma'am.

1103
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:40,348
Sleep tight.

1104
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:06,239
Leaving me all alone.
Lunatics running all over the place...

1105
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:10,677
with husbands you can't see
and chickens bigger than a man.

1106
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:13,718
You can't do this to me,
Bob, you understand?

1107
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:18,032
I won't put up with it another night!
No, I won't! Not another night!

1108
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:30,395
Oh, no. Oh, no.
I'm losing my mind too.

1109
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,119
<i>Oh, Bob!</i>

1110
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:57,158
- What is it?
- Got a message for you, ma'am.

1111
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:07,751
Thanks,
there's no answer.

1112
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:43,271
My goodness, you didn't sleep
in your bed again last night.

1113
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:46,079
Your mother's going to raise the roof
when she hears about this.

1114
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:48,549
And what's more,
I'm going to tell her!

1115
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:52,758
I told you, I can't sleep in it.
It's too soft.

1116
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:55,559
Now, whoever heard
of a bed being too soft?

1117
01:33:55,640 --> 01:34:00,156
Stuff and nonsense. You'll have
no spine left sleeping on that sofa.

1118
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:03,949
You were up early again too.
I heard you moving around the kitchen.

1119
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:07,396
I can't help it, Emmy. I got in the habit.

1120
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:10,552
The minute the sun rises,
I just have to get up.

1121
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:14,110
First thing you'll know, you're going
to be sick, carrying on this way.

1122
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:17,192
- Shall I fix your bath?
- Yeah, bring it in.

1123
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:20,955
- "Bring it in"?
- Hmm? Oh.

1124
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:23,270
Oh, I keep forgetting.

1125
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:27,148
We have a room for
that here, haven't we?

1126
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:31,074
Oh, land sakes, went right out of my mind.
I got a letter for you.

1127
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:35,950
<i>Looks like it might be
from your husband.</i>

1128
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:39,077
- Send it back unopened.
- You mean you're not gonna read it?

1129
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:41,913
No! Send it back!

1130
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:51,073
- Anything from Bob?
- No.

1131
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:55,312
Betty, you don't mean to tell me you're
still sending his mail back unopened.

1132
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:58,517
It's perfectly ridiculous.
No wonder he stopped writing you.

1133
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:03,469
Mother, if he had any real interest in me,
he'd have been here months ago.

1134
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:07,109
Emmy, I told you never to serve me eggs.
I can't stand the sight of them!

1135
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:10,988
You've got to eat. You've got to keep
your strength up.

1136
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:14,072
If I never see another egg,
it'll be all right with me.

1137
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:17,869
Just as you say,
but I won't be responsible.

1138
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:21,919
In my opinion, both you and Bob
are behaving very stupidly.

1139
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,719
Mother, we've been all over this before,
now please, don't.

1140
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,951
You know how I feel about interfering,
but I hate to see a good marriage...

1141
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:31,635
break up because of
a lot of silly stubbornness.

1142
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:34,837
In my opinion, you ought
to keep in touch with him...

1143
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:37,434
especially at this time.

1144
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:40,432
I don't want to be
in touch with him.

1145
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:44,752
Nothing in the whole world would
make me go back to him again!

1146
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:46,990
Nothing.

1147
01:35:57,080 --> 01:36:02,200
Isn't it funny how a little bit of nothing
like this makes everything else so unimportant?

1148
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:05,795
You fight and struggle
and argue and...

1149
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:08,110
do crazy things.

1150
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:10,794
None of it makes
any difference.

1151
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:13,553
This is what really counts.

1152
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:20,955
Mother, I'm going back to Bob
just as soon as I can.

1153
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:30,958
We're coming into your station, ma'am.
Better be getting started.

1154
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:35,556
Thank you.
Well, here we go.

1155
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:39,155
Get ready
to surprise your father.

1156
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:54,675
It won't be long now, darling.

1157
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:57,718
It's not much,
but it's home.

1158
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:02,351
Remember, don't be too hard on it.
It'll grow on you after a while.

1159
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:05,398
So will your father
when you get to know him.

1160
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:09,075
He's a pretty nice fellow
in many ways.

1161
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:13,278
Of course, he has some
strange ideas about how to live.

1162
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:17,990
He can be taken in by any
designing female in a station wagon.

1163
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:21,959
But on the whole,
he's really swell...

1164
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:27,112
and awful cute.

1165
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:31,239
Full of high ideals.

1166
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:35,871
You could do a lot worse than
to grow up to be just like him.

1167
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:45,309
What are you
stopping here for?

1168
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:48,312
- You're lookin' for your husband, ain't ya?
- Yes?

1169
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:50,675
Well, that's
where he lives.

1170
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:58,516
<i>Well, ain't you goin'in?</i>

1171
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:01,194
Drive back to the station.

1172
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:10,516
Oh, you poor child.
It's not your fault he's your father.

1173
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:13,717
Don't you worry.

1174
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:17,998
They say there's nothing
to heredity anyway.

1175
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:20,913
But if you ever grow up to be like him,
I'll never speak to you again...

1176
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,549
as long as I live.

1177
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:28,553
Oh, I only wish I had him here
a minute. I'd show him.

1178
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:31,154
And that woman too.

1179
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:35,513
Driver! Stop!

1180
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:38,478
- Huh?
- Go right back to that house.

1181
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:40,710
Yes, indeedy!

1182
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:52,196
- Would you hold her for me for a minute?
- Huh?

1183
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:54,191
- Ain't I gonna get to see nothin'?
- No!

1184
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:56,748
But you're going
to hear plenty!

1185
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,710
Get away from me, you traitor!

1186
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:07,395
<i>Very cosy.</i>

1187
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:16,476
- Betty?
- Don't you "Betty" me, you, you bluebeard!

1188
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:18,676
- "Bluebeard"?
- You could hardly wait till I got out of your way...

1189
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:21,558
so you could move over here with that
silly woman and her station wagon...

1190
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:24,108
- and her automatic milkers...
- Now, wait a minute...

1191
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:26,270
Wait 'til she finds out you're more
interested in those automatic milkers...

1192
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:28,191
- than you are in her!
- Listen to me...

1193
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:30,669
- I gave you the best years of my life!
- One year!

1194
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:34,196
It seemed like 10! Washing, ironing,
cooking, keeping house...

1195
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:37,238
tending pigs, chasing cows,
hatching eggs!

1196
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:42,519
And for what? So you could run off with
the first idiot who made eyes at you.

1197
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:45,273
- Are you through?
- Yes, I am for the moment.

1198
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:47,954
If you have anything to say,
you'd better make it good.

1199
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:52,158
I'll make it good, all right. I'm not
living with Harriet, as you seem to think.

1200
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:54,515
I'm living by myself,
and do you know why?

1201
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:58,149
Because my wife walked out on me before I had
a chance to tell her I bought this farm for her.

1202
01:39:58,240 --> 01:40:00,595
- You what?
- Yes, I bought it.

1203
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:03,194
I hocked everything I owned
to make the down payment.

1204
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:05,999
I wanted to surprise you. You were
wonderful and worked so hard.

1205
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:08,514
- Don't think I didn't know and appreciate it.
- Oh, Bob!

1206
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:11,558
Then what do you do?
The night I'm closing the deal...

1207
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:14,234
after spending the whole afternoon
listening to her silly talk...

1208
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:16,914
and sitting through a nine-course dinner
with crepe suzettes, which you know I hate...

1209
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:20,231
and I finally get her to sign the deal
after promising half my life away...

1210
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:23,471
I go home and what do I find?
A big sign: "I'm through!"

1211
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:27,872
- Gone, just like that!
- Bob, I... I didn't know.

1212
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:31,919
If you'd have had the decency
to read my letters, you'd have known.

1213
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,434
<i>- It's all in here.
- Oh, no, don't!</i>

1214
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:45,628
Bob, I'm so sorry.

1215
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:50,351
It's like this, Betty.

1216
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:53,557
If two people are going to get along,
they just have to believe in each other.

1217
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:56,313
No matter what, always.

1218
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:01,549
- Oh, Betty.
- Oh, Bob.

1219
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:04,632
- I'm glad you're back.
- Oh, darling.

1220
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,878
Oh!

1221
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:12,349
- Do you know what day this is?
- Uh-uh.

1222
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:15,000
Happy anniversary.

1223
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:18,038
I mean, happy day
after our anniversary.

1224
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:20,475
Same to you
and many of them.

1225
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:29,636
- Do you remember this?
- What?

1226
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:34,910
- Oh.
- We're a little off schedule, aren't we?

1227
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:39,152
- Don't worry, darling. We'll make it.
- Where you going?

1228
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:42,596
I've got a surprise
for you.

1229
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:04,118
- Right on schedule.
- Yeah.

1230
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:07,636
Well, here.

1231
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:10,188
- What's his name?
- Anne.

1232
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:12,350
Oh.

1233
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:16,672
<i>- Glad to know you, Anne.
- Mr Bob! Mr Bob!</i>

1234
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:19,320
Better come right away, Mr Bob!
We got trouble in the chicken house.

1235
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:24,428
<i>- Those water pipes again?
- Busted wide open and them hens is goin'crazy! Ten drowned.</i>

1236
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:28,035
- Bob!
- Hmm? Oh!

1237
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:30,111
<i>- I'll be right with ya!
- Okay!</i>

1238
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:38,190
Don't go away, you two!

1239
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:44,193
You see what I mean?
I could write a book.

1240
01:42:45,305 --> 01:43:45,748
