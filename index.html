                    <p>This is a draft study of word counts in American film dialogue using a dataset built from
                        community created SRT files in the <a href="https://www.opensubtitles.org">OpenSubtitles</a>
                        repository. A selected
                        list of films was
                        generated from Wikipedia "year in film" articles from 1927 to 2022, using the top ten grossing
                        movies for each year. As well Wikipedia 'decade in film' lists from the 1970s – 2010s rounded
                        out
                        the list. Adjusting for a number of factors – including removal of silent films, unavailable SRT
                        files, and
                        duplicate detections – in total 868 films were included in the study.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are three interactive charts created from the dataset. The first showcases films
                        ranked based on their total unique word counts and unique word count average per hour –
                        selectable
                        by decade. The second studies the infamous <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_dirty_words">'seven dirty words'</a> which were
                        part of a 1972 George
                        Carlin comedy routine and were to become part of a <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCC_v._Pacifica_Foundation">Supreme Court decision</a>
                        that helped define the
                        extent to which the federal goverment could regulate speech over public airwaves. And finally
                        there is a tool that allows you to generate charts based on your own word searches.

                        the length of that particular film, clocking in at 201 minutes, and
                        the nature of fantasy dialogue being a bit less conversational when your typical

                    <p>Given how many genres are attached to a single film gathered from <a

                            Database</a>, it's
                        somewhat impractical to color code by genre. But it's still useful to actually uncheck all
                        genres except a particular one. So for example you can look at just Science Fiction, and you
                        will find two comedies
                        take the top spots for most unique words per hour with Son of Flubber (1963), 511 words and The
                        Nutty Professor (1996) 469 words. And in the 'completely makes sense' place for fewest words in
                        Sci-Fi was A Quiet Place II (2021) at 82 words per hour.</p>

                    <p>This particular study is probably the original inspiration for this study given a question I was
                        hoping to originally answer. I have noticed the film industry began moving their blockbuster
                        business away from rated R properties in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It was what I wondered
                        was a 'Little Mermaid' effect, when in 1989 a kid's movie could be the number six grossing film
                        and studios realized out how many unsold tickets exist for an R rated summer blockbuster when
                        kids are unable to attend.
                    </p>
                    <p>I imagined that at the same time there was a 'Die Hard' peak in 1988 Die Hard (1988) had dialogue
                        with prolific and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfpDSNNgYhI">enduring usage of
                            profanity</a>. But the data doesn't show this clearly with the top ten films since the
                        1990s. If you exclude the Bad Boys (2003) as an outlier, the numbers do definitely trend
                        downward to the present. But those Bad Boys For Life (2020) still keep messing with my theory.
                    </p>
                    <p>This question needs a lot more films from each year to get a better sense of trends in profanity
                        usage. The chart intentionally cuts out all films prior to 1968 with zero profanity in top ten
                        films prior to that year. And in an earlier study I had the Wolf of WallStreet (not a top ten
                        film) included, and it holds the F-bomb record at an astounding 500+ utterances.</p>

                        see the most opportunity for advancement in the project. It would be really cool to build a

                        translations as possible to create a querable API of unique word counts and maybe phrase counts
